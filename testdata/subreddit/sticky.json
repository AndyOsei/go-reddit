Really Vancouver and Montreal are 1a and 1b to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ottawa doesn&amp;#39;t have the airport network necessary. You can&amp;#39;t even get a direct flight to Los Angeles. Same thing with Winnipeg, which is the least populous so another ding there. Then I have Calgary over Edmonton because I just think Edmonton is too far north.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No idea on the names but I like alliteration, so the Montreal Maze would be fun&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
